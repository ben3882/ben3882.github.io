Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble
The GNU General Public License is a free software license, used worldwide. The license was originally written by Richard Stallman for the GNU project; he wrote it to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program, to make sure it is free software for all its users.  This license is a legal instrument that ensures the public gets the rights to use the software freely.  It helpfully provides a simple way for authors to ensure that their software will remain free in the future.

This license is not a set of rules or terms, but an expression of your collection of rights, obligations, and responsibilities in the face of the legal environment of software distribution.  Indeed, it presents a kind of social contract between authors and the public. By doing each other favors, both sides get a bit more freedom.  The authors get the ability to share their work freely, and the public gains rights to acquire that work under the required conditions.

Wherever you see the word "the Program", it refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.  A "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, you can modify the Program, and you can also incorporate parts of it into other programs.”

You can also take existing modifications to the Program and combine them with new code under the terms of this License.  Therefore, the intent of this License is to grant you freedom and assure others the ability to share creative work.

The precise rules and regulations defining your rights and obligations are specified below.  The only way to remove or modify your rights under this License is to revoke your own copyright, not to alter this License.
